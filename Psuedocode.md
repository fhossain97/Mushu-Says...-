What do I need to create?

1. AI that runs a pattern
2. A player that will enter their username (name will be displayed)
3. Gameboard with 9 diff colors that lights up 
4. 10 rounds of the game (increasing level of difficulty)
5. A score tracker in the corner (for every square clicked, 1 point will be earned)
6. Reset button in corner of screen 
7. Restart game option at end of game
8. Audio aspect for each square that is clicked and background audio
9. Popup animation for each level (win or lose)
10. Message on screen for next level once you pass/encouraging words such as "Great Job"

How do I create it?

1. Use MathRandom and conditionals (maybe loops)
2. Use a modal to get player to enter their name
3. Build a 9 square chess board with a seperate ID for each and an overall class for them. Use keyframe to add in a glowing effect with a timer
4. Set the game levels to 10 and use conditionals
5. Use addEventListener and DOM to create a score board
6. Add a reset button in HTML and give it a value and maybe link that to a function in JS
7. Add a restart button in HTML that will pop up at the end and link it to a function in JS
8. Use addEventListener and DOM to create a score board

9. Modals
10. May need to run an alert inside a function and/or use DOM

How do I plan out my schedule?

//4/27 - Psuedocode and planning
4/28 - Loosely code the HTML and the CSS: build the board and scoreboard. Color code each square with keyframes/glow feature (3,5 and some of 6 and 7)
4/29 - Cry. Start building the game levels and the modal (1,2,4)
4/30 - Continue to build the game levels and get the images for the animations (Mushu and Meeshu pics) (1,2,4) *** Bulk of the javascript needs to be done
5/1 - Continue to build the game levels (1,2,4,6,7) *** Bulk of the javascript needs to be done
5/2 - Continue to build the game levels (1,2,4,6,7) *** Javascript needs to be done
5/3 - Code in the extra features (8,9,10)
5/4 - Finish the HTML and CSS. Try running the game here for potential issues. Write the contents for the README.md file. 
5/5 - Finish the game (including the README.md with wireframe images and link to game) and RUN IT! Double check that everything in the rubric is completed. Also double check the project 1 repo online to make sure everything is completed. (Have Abir play the game for some feedback!)
5/6 - Spend an hour just planning your presentation.
