//use a modal to grab the username and get the animations if Player passes a level (

// let scoreboard () = > {

//scoreboard.addEventListener to add points each time the correct pattern is clicked

//add some loops if (i =0 ; maybe length of pattern will change each level)

//maybe some Jquery with dom.querySelector()
